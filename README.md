This repository illustrates and debates the study of three machine learning algorithms viz., logistic regression, decision tree classification and support vector machine and their capability to understand and foretell the fatalities of patients with Parkinson’s disease. The dataset utilized, enfolds some medical evidence and facts of patients comprising of speech recordings at various frequencies which will foretell the person suffering from Parkinson’s disease. Using this material, we will survey the dataset and classify the class variable by means of several machine learning prototypes and uncover which algorithm is best suited for this dataset. The principal intention is to evaluate the accuracy by classifying the data with regards to efficacy and effectiveness of each algorithm in terms of accuracy and precision.

Parkinson’s is the fastest emerging neurological condition in the world, and presently there is no cure. 1 in 37 people alive today in the UK will be detected with Parkinson’s on their lifetime. Out estimations show that around 145,000 people live with a Parkinson’s diagnosis in the UK in 2020. Broken down within the UK, for 2020, England comprises of 121,000 patients suffering from Parkinson’s. Whereas Scotland has 12,400 patients, Wales with 7,600 and 3,900 people are suffering from Northern Ireland.
