This repository illustrates and debates the study of three machine learning algorithms viz., logistic regression, decision tree classification and support vector machine and their capability to understand and foretell the fatalities of patients with Parkinson’s disease. The dataset utilized, enfolds some medical evidence and facts of patients comprising of speech recordings at various frequencies which will foretell the person suffering from Parkinson’s disease. Using this material, we will survey the dataset and classify the class variable by means of several machine learning prototypes and uncover which algorithm is best suited for this dataset. The principal intention is to evaluate the accuracy by classifying the data with regards to efficacy and effectiveness of each algorithm in terms of accuracy and precision.
